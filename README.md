=====================

Mac OS X script to download hi-res images from various subreddits and store them in a folder for use in random Desktop &amp; Screensaver system preference backgrounds

Overview
-----------

1. Downloads hi-res* files from a set of sub-reddits. Uses several built in command line tools from Mac OS X Developer tools including: curl, tidy, sips, cut, egrep, cp

2. There is a lot that can be done to clean this up and make it a little more robust and configurable but it should do the job.

Feel free to fork and send pull requests. I just hacked this together out of frustration as I could find no tool to do the exact job.
